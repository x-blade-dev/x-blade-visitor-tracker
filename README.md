## Features

- Stores logs in a JSON file
- Provides a simple Blade view to display logs
- Configurable via `config/visitor-tracker.php`
- Excludes specific IPs from logging

```sh
composer require x-blade/x-blade-visitor-tracker
```

### Publish Configuration File
After installation, publish the configuration file:

```sh

This will create a `config/visitor-tracker.php` file where you can modify settings.

You can view visitor logs by accessing:
